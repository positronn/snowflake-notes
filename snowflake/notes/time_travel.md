## Time travel

Snowflake's powerful Time Travel feature enables accessing historical data,
as well as the objects storing the data, at any point within a period of time.
The default window is 24 hours and, if you are using Snowflake Enterprise Edition,
can be increased up to 90 days.

Some useful applications include:
- Restoring data-related objects such as tables, schemas, and databases that may have been deleted.
- Duplicating and backing up data from key points in the past.
- Analyzing data usage and manipulation over specified periods of time.
